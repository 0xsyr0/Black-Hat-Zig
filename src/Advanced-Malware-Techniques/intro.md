# Advanced Malware Techniques

Here we explore sophisticated approaches for staging and executing
malware. These chapters cover:

- Process injection and thread hijacking
- Payload staging (web servers, Windows registry, etc.)
- Callback-based code execution
- Enumerating processes to find suitable targets

These techniques build on the basics and demonstrate how real-world
malware maintains stealth and control.
