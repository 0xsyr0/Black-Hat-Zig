# Basic Payload Management

This section introduces fundamental techniques for storing, encrypting,
obfuscating, and executing payloads. Topics include:

- Payload placement in different sections of an executable
- Encryption routines (XOR, RC4, AES)
- Simple obfuscation methods
- Loading payloads via shellcode or DLLs

Use these chapters to learn how to prepare payloads for later delivery
and execution while evading simple detection.
